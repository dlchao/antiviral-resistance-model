This C++ source code was used to produce the results described in the 
article "The global spread of drug-resistant influenza", published
by the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Much of the model was
based on our previous work described in: 
Kenah E, Chao DL, Matrajt L, Halloran ME, Longini IM Jr (2011) The 
Global Transmission and Control of Influenza. PLoS ONE 6(5): e19515. 
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019515

The Makefile can be used to produce two executables: global, which
runs the model and produces simulated daily output, and yearlyglobal, 
which produces output only once per simulation year. I apologize for
the lack of documentation - please contact me if you need assistance.

Both programs requires the GNU Scientific library 
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to compile.
